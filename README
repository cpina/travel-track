# travel-tracker

From August 2016 to August 2017 we will be traveling and programing for free software projects.

To keep friends and relatives a bit more up-to-date in an easy way I'm building a simple page to fetch Instagram photos, show them, put them in a map, etc.

This is under development, not ready yet.
